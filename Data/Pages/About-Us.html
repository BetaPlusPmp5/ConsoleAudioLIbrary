                        <p><strong>The Console Audio Library</strong> is a specialized online platform dedicated to preserving and documenting the audio hardware, music formats, and sound chip technologies used in retro video game consoles from the 1970s to the early 2000s. These systems, often limited by memory and processing power, required developers to get creative with sound. The result? Some of the most iconic and innovative music in gaming history‚Äîcrafted not with traditional instruments, but with pure code, oscillators, and ingenuity.</p>

                        <p>Before the days of CD-quality streaming, there was no room for high-fidelity audio files. Instead, composers and programmers worked within tight technical boundaries using

                        to build rich, expressive soundtracks.</p>
                        <p>The Console Audio Library explores these formats in detail‚Äîhow they worked, how they were pushed to their limits, and how they defined the sonic identity of entire generations of games. Our goal is not just to catalog the hardware and software, but to tell the story of the people, tools, and creativity behind the soundtracks we still love today.</p>

                        <h5>üéµ Founded</h5>
                        <p>BetaTech started in <strong>2016</strong> as a passion project between two friends who loved retro games and chip music. We didn‚Äôt plan for it to grow, just wanted a creative space where we could tinker with audio, build small tools, and share our love for the weird sounds old consoles made.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                        <h5>üéº Early Work</h5>
                        <p>Our early days were all about <strong>music-for-hire</strong> jobs. We created soundtracks for indie games, mods, and retro, inspired animations using tracker software and hardware synth emulation. We weren‚Äôt chasing fame‚Äîjust having fun working with teams that cared as much about pixel art and bleepy, bloopy music as we did.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                        <h5>üè¢ Growth</h5>
                        <p>As more people found our work, we started building audio tools and archiving old sound chips and formats. By <strong>2021</strong>, we grew from just doing gigs to launching sites, plugins, and preservation efforts focused on keeping the spirit of retro audio alive. We didn't set out to "scale", it just kind of happened naturally, and we rolled with it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                        <h5>üåê Present Day</h5>
                        <p>Now known more broadly as <strong>Beta++</strong>, we still operate as a chill team of two. We work with cool people around the world but always keep things personal, independent, and creative. No big office, no suits‚Äîjust headphones, ideas, and a shared appreciation for the art of sound.</p>

                        <p>We make retro-style audio libraries, design simple tools for musicians and devs, and keep track of the classic tech that inspired us growing up. Whether it‚Äôs a VST plugin that mimics a 1990s chip or a clean scan of a forgotten spec sheet, our goal is to make this stuff easy to access and fun to explore.</p>

                        <p>Beta++ exists because we believe game audio is art, not just background noise. We're not trying to be a corporation, we're trying to be caretakers for a part of digital culture that often gets ignored. This isn‚Äôt about making millions. It‚Äôs about making something that lasts and inspires someone else to create, just like we were inspired.</p>

                        <p>We‚Äôve worked with small dev teams, hobbyist ROM hackers, retro console modders, and even a few universities and docs. Every client we work with is someone who "gets it"‚Äîsomeone who sees value in classic sound and wants to do something meaningful with it. If you‚Äôre into that, we‚Äôre into helping.</p>

                        <p>Even though we work remotely with people all over the world, this group of islands we call the Caribbean is still our anchor, a reminder that creativity doesn‚Äôt need skyscrapers or massive teams to thrive.</p>
